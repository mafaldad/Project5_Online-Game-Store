# Project Title: Videogame Store Analysis - EDA & Hypothesis Testing

**Overview:** This project analyzes video game sales, user and critic reviews, genres, and platforms using open-source data. The goal is to identify patterns that determine the success of video games, forecast future sales, and inform potential advertising campaigns. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hypothesis testing to support business decisions for Ice, a global video game store.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed data by correcting column names, adjusting data types, handling missing values, and addressing “TBD” cases.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted analysis to uncover patterns in game releases, platform performance, and genre popularity over time.
* Hypothesis Testing: Tested hypotheses regarding user ratings for different platforms (Xbox One vs. PC) and genres (Action vs. Sports).
* Sales Forecasting: Analyzed historical data to forecast sales trends for the year 2017.
*Data Visualization: Created scatter plots, box plots, and distribution graphs using Matplotlib to represent trends and correlations.

**Key Insights:**

* Platform Trends: PS2 and DS had the highest total sales, while newer platforms like PS4 and Xbox One showed high sales potential.
* Genre Insights: Action and Shooter genres were the most profitable, while Puzzle and Strategy genres had the lowest average sales.
* User Ratings: Hypothesis testing showed no significant difference in user ratings between Xbox One and PC, but significant differences were found between Action and Sports genres.
* Sales Correlations: There is a moderate positive correlation between critic scores and sales on the PS4 platform.

**Tools Used:**

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
* Statistical Testing (SciPy): Performed hypothesis testing to assess differences in user ratings across platforms and genres.
